<h3>Singleton Design Pattern</h3>

<p>Our desktop pages opening field designed with singleton design pattern so if you open a page your data will be saved when you closed to
it will run while program lives.</p>

<h3>Facade Design Pattern</h3>

<p>After preparing Exam and manipulating questions(add,remove) now you can choose student list from excell document, and you can choose
your class rooms where exam doing and your supervisors for class rooms. After you handled all this work you can hit the make exam button
for start all the process. Facade works when you push make exam button, your exam inspection list's will be prepared for every class room
